//
// scripts/ui-guard.mjs — the checkable subset of the frontend standard, enforced by a
// deterministic scan instead of by somebody noticing in review.
//
// Every rule here is one Justin has had to correct by hand, more than once:
//
//   no-table         a plain <table>. Tables are the ReUI Data Grid, with grouping and the
//                    advanced filter builder.
//   no-pie-chart     pie / doughnut charts, in any library.
//   no-vertical-bar  a recharts <BarChart> without layout="vertical". Recharts names it
//                    backwards: layout="vertical" IS the horizontal bar. A genuine time
//                    series on the x-axis is the exception — suppress it with a reason.
//   no-raw-color     hex / rgb() / hsl() literals in colour props and style objects,
//                    Tailwind arbitrary colours (bg-[#0f766e]), and palette utilities
//                    (text-gray-500, bg-teal-600). Use the design tokens: bg-primary,
//                    text-muted-foreground, var(--chart-1). This is how a console ends up
//                    teal, or orange, when nobody asked for a brand colour.
//   no-custom-palette  a .css theme that tints --primary / --secondary / --accent / --ring
//                    (or their -foreground). ReUI's default theme keeps those achromatic;
//                    a hue there IS the custom brand palette — measured: a teal console
//                    (--primary: 191 91% 33%) and an orange one nobody asked for. Chart,
//                    destructive and sidebar-primary tokens are coloured by default and are
//                    not checked.
//   dark-default     the root <html> in a layout (or an .astro page) without `dark` in its
//                    class. Dark is the default; the header toggle offers light.
//   app-shell        a page under pages/ that renders <html> itself instead of going
//                    through the shared layout. What this CANNOT see: whether that layout is
//                    actually built on a ReUI app-shell block. It only proves that every page
//                    goes through *a* layout, which is the part a regex can measure.
//   base-ui-style    components.json declares a style whose LIBRARY is not Base UI. The style
//                    is {library}-{theme} (base-nova, base-vega, radix-nova, radix-vega) and
//                    only the `base` library is Base UI; the theme is a look, not an API. Base UI is
//                    the standard primitive layer (shadcn made it the default on 2026-07-03;
//                    ReUI's blocks are built on it). A repo on new-york-v4 gets radix
//                    primitives, and a Base UI block dropped onto radix primitives does not
//                    fail loudly - radix ignores `render`, `delay`, `closeDelay` and friends,
//                    so the trigger renders and does nothing.
//   no-radix         an import of `@radix-ui/*` or `radix-ui`, anywhere including the
//                    vendored components/ui/ wrappers - this is the one rule that looks
//                    inside them, because that is where the primitive layer lives and the
//                    whole point is which library it is.
//   select-wrapper   a raw <SelectValue> outside the vendored wrappers. NEITHER library
//                    renders the selected item's LABEL on its own: radix resolves the
//                    trigger's text from the mounted item (absent during SSR), and Base UI
//                    renders the raw value unless Select.Root is given `items`. Measured
//                    both ways - a trigger that paints `__all__` on first load, and one
//                    that paints an assignee id. The fix is one shared wrapper that
//                    resolves the label; this rule is what stops a call site going round it.
//   light-theme      a theme .css whose `:root` IS the dark theme (its --background darker
//                    than its --foreground), or that defines --background/--foreground/--card
//                    in `:root` with no counterpart in a dark block; and an HTML entry that
//                    hardcodes `class="dark"` on <html> in a repo where nothing toggles the
//                    `dark` class on documentElement at runtime. Dark is the DEFAULT, not the
//                    only theme: every surface must render in both. Measured on
//                    colby-chrome-ext before PR #13 - eleven entries pinned to `class="dark"`,
//                    the dark values sitting in `:root`, and a trailing `.dark` block holding
//                    nine overrides, so there was no light theme to switch to.
//   font-size-floor  a font size below 12px in code the repo owns: `text-[11px]`,
//                    `text-[0.6875rem]`, or a CSS `font-size` under the floor. 12px is
//                    text-xs and it is a HOUSE rule, not ReUI's - ReUI's own kit/badge.tsx
//                    ships text-[0.6rem] for size="xs" - so registry-installed source is
//                    exempt (see REGISTRY below), because `shadcn add` reverts an edit to it.
//   off-reason       a rule switched off in .ui-guard.json with no migration reference. An
//                    opt-out has to name the task that ends it, or it is permanent and
//                    nobody can tell.
//
//   node scripts/ui-guard.mjs              scan src/ and web/; exit 1 on any violation
//   node scripts/ui-guard.mjs --warn       same output, always exit 0
//   node scripts/ui-guard.mjs --json       a JSON array instead of lines
//   node scripts/ui-guard.mjs <dir>        scan another repo root (read-only)
//
// Suppress ONE line with a comment on that line or the line above it:

// The reason is required. An allow without one is itself a violation (allow-reason).
//

//
// Switching a rule off needs a `migration` entry naming what ends the exemption - a task
// id, a PR, a dated decision. Without one the repo gets an `off-reason` violation
// instead, because an opt-out nobody can attribute is just the rule being deleted.
//
// Skipped always: node_modules, dist, .astro, and the vendored component directories
// components/ui/, components/reui/, components/blocks/ — ReUI and shadcn source is not ours
// to lint — plus any backend/ directory (server code, HTML email). `no-radix` is the one
// exception and runs inside the vendored directories too: which primitive library the
// wrappers wrap is exactly the thing being checked. Zero dependencies, Node 22.

 * Measured on colby-chrome-ext 2026-11-01: `components/reui/` and `components/ui/` hold
 * BOTH kinds of file side by side. The seven single-file primitives sitting flat in them -
 * reui/{badge,frame,tag-input}.tsx, ui/{button,input,number-field,switch}.tsx - are
 * hand-edited and shared verbatim across three extensions, so they are ours and the floor
 * applies. The multi-file blocks `shadcn add` writes into SUBdirectories of the same
 * parents - reui/{kit,code-block,data-grid,event-calendar,filters}/ - are not.
 *
 * A flat file can still be registry-installed: ui/questionnaire.tsx (322 lines) imports
 * `@shadcn/react/questionnaire` and ships `text-[0.625rem]`. So the third test is the fact
 * in the file rather than its path - an import from a registry primitive namespace is what
 * `shadcn add` writes and what it will revert. ui/calendar.tsx has no such import and is
 * not exempted by any of the three; it passes on VALUE (its smallest size is 0.8rem =
 * 12.8px, above the floor), which is the honest reason and not an exemption.
 *
 * Nothing else is exempt. A new registry install flat in `components/ui/` that carries no
 * such import and breaks the floor is FLAGGED, which asks a human instead of guessing - and
 * `ui-guard-allow font-size-floor: <why>` on the line is the answer when it is genuinely

 * `:root[data-theme="dark"]`, `html[data-theme="dark"]`, `:root.dark` and `[data-mode=
 * "dark"]` were each told their correctly-paired theme was single-theme. The first of those
 * is the convention this ecosystem's own artifact guidance prescribes, and the third is the
 * shape the old pattern's comment claimed to handle.
 *
 * That direction of error is the expensive one. A false negative fails toward silence; a
 * false positive on correct code spends the credibility the rule needs, and earns itself an
 * `off` in .ui-guard.json from someone who is right to distrust it.
 *
 * The CLASS branch requires the name to be exactly `dark`, and `(?![\w-])` is doing two
 * jobs there. `.darkroom` was never a problem - `k` to `r` is no boundary - but `\b` ALONE
 * let `.dark-panel` through, because a word boundary sits between `k` and `-`. That is a
 * false negative in the pairing check rather than a false positive: a `dark-`prefixed
 * COMPONENT class supplying all three core tokens satisfies the pair, so a single-theme
 * file passes. Measured, 0 violations before this:

 *     .dark-panel { --background: oklch(0.3 0 0); --foreground: oklch(0.9 0 0);   ... }
 *
 * `:root` is genuinely light so the lightness test passes, and `.dark-panel` completes the
 * pair, so neither check fires - two checks do not save you when one class satisfies both.
 * `.dark-overlay`, `.dark-scrim` and especially `.dark-mode-only` are ordinary class names,
 * and whether one of them happens to set those three tokens is luck, not design.
 *
 * The ATTRIBUTE branch deliberately keeps `\b`, because a VALUE is not a name:

 * `light-theme`, the CSS half: a theme file has to carry BOTH themes.

 * Two checks, because either alone passes a file that has no light theme:
 *
 *  1. `:root` must BE the light theme. Its --background lighter than its --foreground.
 *     colby-chrome-ext before PR #13 had `:root { --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);
 *     --foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0) }` - near-black on near-white, which is the dark
 *     theme wearing the default selector, so switching to light had nowhere to go.
 *  2. Each core token in `:root` needs its counterpart in a dark block. That same file's
 *     trailing `.dark` held nine overrides and none of these three, so a pairing check
 *     catches it even without the lightness test - and the lightness test catches the
 *     opposite shape, a file that defines the dark values in both places.
 *
 * A file whose `:root` carries no theme token at all is not a theme file and gets no
 * claim either way. Suppressing this one is `.ui-guard.json` with a `migration` entry,
 * not a line comment: the .css scan has never read allow comments.
